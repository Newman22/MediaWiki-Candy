MediaWiki-Candy
===============

Candy is a MediaWiki skin that can be used as your VERY own fairy tale resort on an URL!

A pink variation of Referata's Tufte.

NOTE: Make sure to delete the i18n_old file and i18n1 folder when installing Candy on your wiki.

Installation
===============
Download the latest snapshot and extract it to your skins directory. Then include it in your [LocalSettings.php](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:LocalSettings.php) file as in the following example:
```php
wfLoadSkin( 'Candy' );
